COMP9417 - Machine Learning and Data Mining
http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs9417

Topic 3 - Genetic Algorithms
Goal: Implement the basic genetic algorithm algorithm (described at http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~mike/comp9417/ass2/ga.pdf) to learn classification rules.

package geneticalgo - contains all the core files related to the genetic algorithm
balanceScale - the first attempt at implementing a solution to this dataset
scale - the second attempt
mushroom - core code relating to finding rules in the mushroom dataset
dataset - contains all of the datasets used. the *super.cleaned files have everything but the essentials stripped out, useful for grepping

To run the code, compile it 

   $ javac $(find . -name "*.java")
   
To run the balance scale problem use

   $ java geneticalgo/Main s 1
   
To run the mushroom problem

   $ java geneticalgo/Main m 1
   
To run the first failed attempt at the balance scale problem

   $ java geneticalgo/Main b 1
